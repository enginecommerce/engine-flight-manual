# Congratulations! You are a Mentor

You have been assigned to mentor and to pair with a new Engine Developer as they learn the ropes and begin their journey to become an effective member of our team.

For a brief period you will be their pairing partner, but that will change as you teach them to work with the rest of the team. No matter who their pairing partner is, you will always remain their mentor and you will help them set and achieve personal growth goals; eventually teaching them to do the same with others.

# About Your Mentee's New Gear

The new member has been assigned:

* A laptop
* A set of headphones
* A desk (and likely an external monitor)

Their laptop has already been secured with a password and the disk has been encrypted.

These are their tools for exercising their craft. Stickers and cover customizations are encouraged. Likewise, certain software has been installed to ease onboarding, but while we are still a small team, anyone on the team may use whatever software needed to get things done.

**When hardware breaks,** Egine pays for support, so always tell your manager immediately -- using Slack is best. We will do our best to get everyone back on their feet as soon as possible.

# Whatâ€™s Next?

## Invitations Waiting in Their New Engine Email Account

Before their first day, your Mentee had a new engine email account created for them. In their inbox they have invitations waiting from the following services:

* Slack
* Clubhouse
* Github (geminivmp and enginecommerce)
* Tuple
* Keybase

## Their Next Steps

* They should accept the github invitation to join Gemini MVP from [https://github.com/geminimvp](https://github.com/geminimvp).
* They should accept the github invitation to join Engine Commerce from [https://github.com/enginecommerce](https://github.com/enginecommerce).
* From their Engine email account, they should follow invitations for:
  * Slack
  * Keybase
  * Tuple
* Once their Keybase account is created, they should use Keybase to request access to the Engine team from their manager.
* From the [Engine Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), they create a 1:1 meeting with your mentor 1 week from now at a time your mentor is available.
* From the [Engine Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), they create a 1:1 meeting with your manager 1 week from now at a time your manager is available.

## Your First Project Together

Once they have accepted the above accounts, you should help them clone and run [engine_storefront](https://github.com/geminimvp/engine_storefront). _**NOTE: Remember to guide them to [generate an OAuth token before](https://github.com/geminimvp/engine_storefront#generate-a-github-oauth-token) they attempt to bundle Gemini gems**_

Your first goal should be to enable them to make a change that they can PR their first or second day. Through this, they should become familiar with the following Engine practices:

* Clubhouse card flow
* Clubhouse card stakeholder communication
* Slack communication
* Writing sufficient tests
* PR feedback and revisions
* Review servers
* Staging servers
* Production

Hopefully, they will be able to see their change live and in production on their second or third day.

## Their Second Project and Beyond

As their mentor, it is entirely up to you when they should pair with another member of the team.

Before they are ready to move on to their second project, you should make a recommendation to their project manager 1) what project your mentee would be well-suited to and 2) who they should pair with -- this may still be you.

Their project manager will be aware that you are their mentor and he/she will ask you for your pairing or solo recommendation regularly.

## Their First 1:1 With You

In the above steps, your mentee will create a 1:1 meeting with you to review their first week's progress. These meetings are invaluable for our organization. They help us to know how we are growing and what steps to take next.

Use the Engine 1:1 guide to help you navigate the meeting and to help them set and reach personal goals, and then follow up with your/their manager.
