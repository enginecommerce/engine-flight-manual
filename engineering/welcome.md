# Your Mentor

When you arrive, a Senior Developer will be assigned to mentor you and to pair with you as you walk through the steps below. For a brief period they will be your pairing partner, but that will change as you work with the rest of the team; however, they will remain your mentor.

During your time at Engine, they will work with you to help you set and achieve personal growth goals, and eventually you will do this with others.

# Your New Gear

Every engineering team member is assigned a laptop and a set of headphones; these are tools for exercising your craft, so it is your job to maintain them. Feel free to make them yours with software and cover customizations – install whatever software you like to get things done.

When hardware breaks, tell your manager immediately. We will do our best to get you back on your feet as soon as possible.

Your laptop has already been secured with a password and the disk has been encrypted.

* Homebrew, asdf, PostgreSQL, and support libraries for running [engine_storefront](https://github.com/geminimvp/engine_storefront)
* Visual Studio Code and iTerm 2
