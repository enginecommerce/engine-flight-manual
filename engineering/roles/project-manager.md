## Your Job Is

To engine Stakeholders, you are the gate keeper of Engineering team time and attention. To the Engine Engineering team, your eyes are on the future, and you are the facilitator and scheduler of work to be done _next_. To Engine senior management, you are the guardian of efficiency and the analytic eye on our expectations vs. reality.

<mark>You do your job best 1) when you ensure Stakeholders journal objective criteria before engineering work begins, 2) when you favor processes over personalities to get work done, 3) when you clarify both <em>work to be done</em> and <em>work not to be done</em> in each Sprint, 4) when you monitor the progress and efficiency of your Engineering team, 5) when you protect the undisturbed attention of team engineers, and 6) when you help management analyze and refine Engine processes.</mark>

You are the facilitator and connector of people and processes across teams. You are not responsible for understanding the technical intricacies of projects under your supervision, you are not responsible to answer questions, <mark>but you are the facilitator that ensures records are kept of Stakeholder objectives, Engineering team estimates, and Engineering progress.</mark>

### Daily

* **For all new projects,** form project engineering teams and facilitate communication to plan, monitor, and report project progress
* **Help work get done** – remove communication and work blockers and continually clarify project direction for all members involved
* **Hold a morning standup meeting among team engineers** – engineers should state what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and whether there are impediments to expected progress
* **In Clubhouse,** ensure members of your engineering team have the right amount of work for the current Sprint and that work is divided into cards that require roughly two days each
* Ensure that the team continually adheres to Engine Project Management best practices

### Bi-Weekly

* **During 1-On-1 time with your manager,** bring your insights into our process and how it affects your job happiness; use 1-On-1 time to help shape your career into what you want

### Per Engineering Sprint

* **Hold a Sprint Round Table with the leaders of your Engineering team,** and work with these leaders to triage and prioritize objectives and resources available for the upcoming 2-week Sprint
* **During the Project Management retrospective,** discuss process efficiency obstacles and gains with other Project Managers and Project Management leadership


## Assumptions

* Assume you will have to often repeat that estimates are merely best guesses and all features require objectivity for successful triage when timelines tighten
* Assume nobody ever knows what it takes to launch a feature in production until that feature is launched in production
* Never assume someone will hear/read your comments in your actual voice; expect worse, and write kindly.
* Never assume someone else's comments were written in an angry voice – make an extra effort to take suggestions well.

By continually communicating challenges and performing project triage to ship key performance drivers, you will ensure the timeliness of your Sprints, the satisfaction of our customers, and the happiness of our developer teams.
