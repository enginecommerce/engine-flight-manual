## Your Job Is

To Engine Software Engineers, you are a mentor of good development practices, a source of domain knowledge, and a triage artist for overly-complex projects. To Engine Project Managers, you are a source of pre-planning wisdom from hard-won trench experience. You are not a lone hero/heroine, but a leader who helps others perform at their best.

<mark>You do your job best 1) when you make yourself available to other Software Engineers to pair and solve problems, 2) when you set aside time twice daily to review and make best-practice recommendations on Pull Requests, and 3) when you bring suggestions for architecture and process changes.</mark>

You may personally feel like you're not getting enough done because you will often not be the one committing code; however, through this you will gain exposure to our codebase and will help Software Engineers avoid costly mistakes. With your help, our teams and our practices will improve.

### Daily

* On Github, review Software Engineer pull requests and make constructive, encouraging comments and requests for change
* On Slack, monitor the #dev channel to answer questions quickly and guide Software Engineers to release minimalistic features for later iteration
* In Clubhouse, work with Software Engineers and Project Managers to plan, triage, and prioritize stories

### Weekly/Bi-Weekly

* During the Engineering Retrospective, bring suggestions for architectural and process improvements for prioritization
* During weekly Sprint Reviews, work with the dev team and Project Manager to prioritize and break up stories for 2-to-3-day execution
* During 1-On-1 time with your manager, bring your insights into our process and how it affects your job happiness; use 1-On-1 time to help shape your career into what you want

### Per Project Phase

* Help create engineering specifications and timeline estimates
* Be a good triage coach – repeat often that estimates are merely best guesses and all features require objectivity for successful triage when timelines tighten

## Assumptions

* Assume you will never fully know what it takes to launch feature in production until that feature is launched in production
* Assume coworkers have made the best decision they were able to make as you write your advice
* Never assume someone will hear/read your critiques in your actual voice; expect worse, and write kindly.
* Never assume someone else's comments were written in an angry voice – make an extra effort to take suggestions well.

By continually communicating challenges and performing project triage to ship key performance drivers, you will ensure the timeliness of your Sprints, the satisfaction of our customers, and the happiness of our Software Engineering teams.
