## Your Job Is

You are entrusted with writing and helping to define software tests that ensure the quality of our products and their continually successful operation. To Engine project Stakeholders, you are a guide to help clarify and journal objective goals and project outcomes. To Engineers, you are the referee and gate keeper of an objective finish line to each Sprint. To Engine leadership, you are the guardian of processes and software that ensure quality in our products.

<mark>You do your job best 1) when you are not shy to pair with other Engine Software Engineers to share knowledge and solve problems, 2) when you make yourself available to project planners to help journal objective pass/fail criteria from stakeholders, 3) when you accept advice from Engine Senior Software Engineers in Pull Requests, and 4) when you bring suggestions for process changes to Engineering leadership.</mark>

### Daily

* While pairing, you will encourage your pair programming partner with your can-do attitude, teachability, and curiosity
* On Github, you will respond to Engine Senior Software Engineer feedback to make changes to Pull Requests quickly
* On Slack, monitor the #dev channel to answer questions quickly and guide Software Engineers to release clearly-testable, minimalistic features for later iteration
* In [Clubhouse][clubhouse_projects_url], make comments on your progress and work with a Project Manager to break larger stories into several smaller stories, so you can complete at least one feature story card every two to three days
* In Clubhouse, keep cards tidy and in their appropriate place, so stakeholders can easily see progress they can understand

### Bi-Weekly

* During weekly Sprint Reviews, work with the rest of your team and Project Manager to prioritize and break up feature stories for two-to-three-day execution
* During 1-On-1 time with your manager, bring your insights into our process and how it affects your job happiness; use 1-On-1 time to help shape your career into what you want

### Per Engineering Sprint

* Be available to Project Managers and Stakeholders to help create objective goals that make for more-accurate estimates
* Get good at performing feature triage to meet timeline estimates
* Be ready to shift your effort, based on stakeholder and market and feedback

## Assumptions

* Assume you will have to often repeat that estimates are merely best guesses and all features require objectivity for successful triage when timelines tighten
* Assume nobody ever knows what it takes to launch a feature in production until that feature is launched in production
* Never assume someone will hear/read your comments in your actual voice; expect worse, and write kindly.
* Never assume someone else's comments were written in an angry voice â€“ make an extra effort to take suggestions well.

By continually communicating challenges and performing feature triage to ship key performance drivers, you will ensure the timeliness of your Sprints, the satisfaction of our customers, and the happiness of our engineering teams.
