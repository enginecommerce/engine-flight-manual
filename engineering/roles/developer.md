## Your Job Is

You are the caped hero or heroine to our clients and the creator of things that do not yet exist. By keeping an optimistic view and an accessible, teachable attitude, you will deliver features and projects on time and help non-technical users navigate the unfamiliar waters of custom software.

<mark>You do your job best 1) when you are not shy to pair with other Engine Developers to share knowledge and solve problems, 2) when you speak up to get assistance and assist others in the Slack #dev channel , 3) when you accept advice from Engine Senior Developers in Pull Requests, and 4) when you help break large feature stories down into individual stories that you can accomplish in two to three days.</mark>

You may personally feel like you're not ready for the challenge at hand. That is simply imposter syndrome, and everybody goes through it; the best counter for imposter syndrome is to be vocal, get assistance, and overcome challenges together with someone else quickly.

Remain curious, unafraid to learn, and teachable; and you will improve your craft, avoid mistakes, and help others do the same.

### Daily

* While pairing, you will encourage your pair programming partner with your can-do attitude, teachability, and curiosity
* On Github, you will respond to Engine Senior Developer feedback to make changes to Pull Requests quickly
* On Slack, ask questions sooner than later in the [#dev channel][dev_channel_url], and release minimalist feature solutions for later iteration
* In [Clubhouse][clubhouse_projects_url], make comments on your progress and work with a Project Manager to break larger stories into several smaller stories, so you can complete at least one feature story card every two to three days
* In Clubhouse, keep cards tidy and in their appropriate place, so stakeholders can easily see progress they can understand

### Weekly/Bi-Weekly

* During weekly Sprint Reviews, work with the rest of your team and Project Manager to prioritize and break up feature stories for two-to-three-day execution
* Push yourself to complete feature stories with as minimalist an interpretation as possible to shorten timelines

### Per Project Phase

* Be available to Project Managers to help create timeline estimates
* Get good at performing feature triage to meet timeline estimates
* Take a step back occasionally and work with Project Managers to intentionally and quickly smooth rough edges that aren't ready for client preview
* Be ready to shift your effort, based on stakeholder and market and feedback?

## Assumptions

* Assume you will never fully know what it takes to launch feature in production until that feature is launched in production
* Never let yourself get stuck; before you get stuck, take the initiative to pair with a Senior Developer to overcome roadblocks
* Never let yourself get bored; if you're waiting for any reason, push yourself and ask to jump in on feature you are interested in or, even better, have zero experience with
* Never assume someone else's comments were written in an angry voice â€“ make an extra effort to take suggestions well.

By continually communicating challenges and performing feature triage to ship key performance drivers, you will ensure the timeliness of your sprints and the happiness of our customers.
