<p>Variants are varieties of a product that you can sell.</p>
<p>These varieties are determined by the <code>Option Types</code> you add to your product in the Product Details tab</p>
<p>For your product to have access to these option types, set up the option types in your site through the Option Types link under the Products dropdown menu</p>
<p>To Add Varients you need to:

    <li>Add Option Types to your Product</li>
    <li>Attach appropriate values of option types to new variants</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>To adjust the prices of the individual variants, go to the <code>Prices</code> tab and see the table of <code>Varients</code>. Updating the Variants tab will automatically populate that table.</p>
