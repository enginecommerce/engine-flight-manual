# Our Values

## Experimentation over Convention

We believe that we will only become better by challenging the way we have done things before. We encourage experimentation, so that we may learn the undiscovered and better way forward that awaits us.

## Process over Personality

We believe that the best ideas are tested ones, not just loud ones.

## Transparency

We believe honest dealings and clearly stated goals will help us work together better and remain accountable to the better angels of our nature.

## Mentorship and Teamwork create Growth

Engine positions of authority exist to mentor and support our teams. Final decisions still rest with points of authority, but those decisions should always come with input from, consensus from, and thoughtful consideration for the teams they support.
