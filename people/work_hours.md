# Work Hours

## Maintain Core Hours from 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM

We expect team members to be reachable from 9:00 to 15:00, local time or when they have stated. If you are able to be more productive outside of typical office hours, do it and let coworkers know.

We are building an environment where each other's working and focusing hours are respected; so focus when you need to, respond attentively when you are able, and be courteous of others and their need to focus in kind.

## Expect to Answer the Call

Expect our distributed team from around the world may call on your expertise at any time to remove roadblocks. It is your responsibility to be reliably reachable during these core hours via Slack.

## Reach Out with Courtesy

Our team spans multiple time zones, so be aware and courteous of the time zone of your intended contact.

### Ask your question via Slack and be patient for a response

* Respect each other's working/focusing hours
* Expect that your request will be treated with respect, but as non-urgent.
* **If your need is urgent, say so, and feel free to make a Slack call that rings loudly and forever**
* If you have not received a response for longer than 10 minutes during core hours, you may feel free to message again politely
* **always wait for a response assuming your intended contact is busy giving an issue the same level of attention you wish for yourself.**

### When someone is contacting you

* Respect your co-workers, but treat Slack messages as non-urgent, unless stated otherwise
* **If a request is urgent, you will receieve a Slack call**

## Focus when it is needed. Be present when answering a request

If you're busy with something important, just respond when you're able; and if it's night, feel free to respond the next day.
