# There are no set limits on days off

If you need a day off, take it. If you have a family obligation, go. In the case of sabbatical-style vacations, we think everyone should be able to find themselves, so your first consecutive week is paid; additional, consecutive weeks are unpaid for as long as you need. In all cases, it is your responsibility to arrange things around your absence with your manager. As the company grows, certain restrictions may become necessary to maintain our work and life balance, but for the time being, our team consists solely of highly motivated, driven professionals who don't need arbitrary restrictions.

# How to plan time off

**First, talk it over with your manager.** Tell your manager what you want to do and when you want to do it. No forms are necessary. This applies to vacation time as well as sick time. Your manager will coordinate with other team members, project managers, etc.

**Next, put it on the _Engine Vacations_ calendar, so everyone can see.** If your name is Betty, create an event named "Betty Out" to represent the time you intend to be unavailable. If you feel like adding more helpful information (notes on location, availability, mobile signal quality, etc.) then add it to the event description, but do not feel obligated. If someone forgot to give you access to the Engine Vacations calendar (sorry in advance) talk to your manager.

**Take up to a week, paid.** Review all time off with your manager. There are no set limits on total days off, so long as elite production expectations are being met. If you need a day off, take it. If you have a family obligation, go. In the case of sabbatical-style vacations, we think everyone should be able to find themselves, so your first consecutive week is paid; additional, consecutive weeks are unpaid for as long as you need.
