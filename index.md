As engineers, we owe a huge debt to several communities of thought and their leaders. Not least among them are [Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/), [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook), [Madriska](https://www.madriska.com/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Solidus](https://solidus.io/).
