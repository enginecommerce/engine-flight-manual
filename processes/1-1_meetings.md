## How to Prepare for a 1:1 Meeting

First, block out 30 minutes to an hour with your manager, and keep in mind that **this is _your_ time.** These 1:1 Meetings exist to give you a forum to help us make improvements and to make this place the best it can be. The tone is expected to be informal, so relax and be yourself.

Second, this outline is just a suggestion. Feel free to follow this guide or to follow the your own script as you see fit. The only thing we ask is that you bring your topics constructively.

### We Suggest You Start with the Following Outline

#### Career Goals

Help us help your career by answering the following questions:

* What are your goals for 6 months, 1 year, 5 years?
* What things have caught your attention at Engine?
* What things have caught your attention in the wider world?

#### The Engine Environment

Help us improve the Engine work environment by bringing the following suggestions:

* Were there good things at other jobs that you would like to see here?
* What are the biggest time wasters?
* Have you encountered the same roadblock here more than once?
* What frustrating things have happened, and how could things have gone differently?
* Has anyone recently done a good job or inspired you?

#### The Engine Review

Help us to improve our processes by suggesting the following:

* Please start doing...
* Please stop doing...
* Please continue doing...

### Need to Cancel? Reschedule Instead

If something comes up, please reschedule your 1:1 meeting. Do not let the time escape, because **we want to hear from you.**
